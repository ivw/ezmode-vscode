# EzMode Tutorial

Welcome to EzMode - fast and intuitive modal editing for modern IDEs.

To enter EzMode, press Escape. The caret will turn orange,
and the mode indicator in the bottom-right corner will show "ez".
In EzMode, character keys are mapped to actions. Ctrl/Alt shortcuts still work normally.

To return to typing, press `t`. In type mode, everything behaves as usual.

I recommend using EzMode as the default mode, using type mode only when actively typing.
Once you're used to it, you can edit quickly without moving your hands off the home row.

## Moving the caret

Use `i`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move, just like the arrow keys.

`u` / `o`: Move backward/forward by word
`h` / `;`: Move to the start/end of a line
`H` / `:`: Move to the start/end of a file
`m` / `M`: Scroll half a page down/up

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- _If you have the AceJump plugin installed:_
To jump to any visible symbol, press `Space`,
then type one or more of the characters you want to jump to,
and type the adjacent tag. -->

## Selecting text

Press `e` to enter select mode, then use movement keys (see above) to extend the selection.

Other ways to enter select mode:
`E`: Select line
`a`: Select word
`A`: Select all

Press `t` to type over the selection, `c` to copy, `d` to delete, or `e` to cancel selection.

```
Exercise: select THIS_WORD and change it to something else.
```

_Hint: combine "select word" and "type": `at`_

```
Exercise: keep this part. Delete this part.
```

_Hint: don't forget `;` from the previous section._

```
exercise: make this whole line upper case
```

_Hint: use `~` to toggle case._

## Basic actions

`z` / `y`: Undo/redo
`x`: Cut
`c`: Copy
`v`: Paste
`s`: Save
`f` / `r`: Find/replace
`/`: Comment line

You probably already know these - they match common Ctrl shortcuts.

To view the full keymap, press `5`.

```
Exercise: Copy this line and paste it 3 more times.
```

_Hint: To copy a line, you don't need to select it. Simply press `c`._

## Brackets and quotes

Type a bracket or quote character like `{} () '' ""` to jump to the nearest surrounding one.
With the caret in that position:
`-`: Select inside the brackets or quotes
`=`: Select around the brackets or quotes
`_`: Remove the brackets or quotes and select the contents

```
exercise(remove, these, arguments)
```

```
exercise + (remove + parentheses)
```

```
exercise('Change the quotes to double quotes')
```

_Hint: After removing the quotes, use `T"` to surround them with double quotes._

## Multiple carets

Press `0` to add the next occurrence of the current selection to the selection.
Press `9` to undo the last added selection.

```
Exercise: Change every 0 to a 1: 0 0 0 0 0
```

```
Exercise: Remove the number next to every x: x0 x1 x2 x3 x4
```

_Hint: Press `e` to exit select mode while keeping the multiple carets._

Press `8`/`*` `.` / `,` to add a new caret below/above.

```
Exercise: Add a dash to the start of these 3 sentences.
Including this one.
And this one.
```

## Files and windows

Use `p` to open any file. Use `w` to close a tab or `W` to close all other tabs.

Use `\` to split the editor into two windows,
or `|` to do the same but without the copy on the left.
Use `q` to move between split windows and `Q` to close a split window.

Toggle tool windows with the lower number keys:
`1`: File tree, `2`: Local changes, `3`: Terminal.
To focus a tool window, use the above keys with shift. Press `Esc` to unfocus.
Use `4` to hide all tool windows.

## Customization

In EzMode, every character key is customizable. You can even define your own modes.
Open your config file by typing `<` in EzMode, and choosing "Edit .ezmoderc".
This will create a template with some examples if the file doesn't already exist.
After editing and saving this file, use `<` again and
choose "Reload .ezmoderc" to apply the changes.

EzMode has many other useful keys. You can always press `5` to see a full list,
